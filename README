Explain how to run your code here.

Project description available at:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-satisfaction/data

First you need access to my data available on:
/scratch/umanduj2/cs63/data/

Alternatively, you can download the data from Kaggle 
and rewrite line 34 in parser.py to point to wherever
your version of the data lies.

Then, you need simply run <python ensemble.py> and 
the program will print out what it's doing (PCA, 
extracting features, augmenting data). When finished,
the program will print data regarding false positives,
false negatives, true positives, true negatives and 
classification accuracy.
